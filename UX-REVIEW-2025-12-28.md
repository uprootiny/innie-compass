**Commit:** [`318f4ad`](https://github.com/uprootiny/innie-compass/commit/318f4adaae7b3cdc10a53c643686ee4a33df0968) — Multilingual phrases, smooth trail, correct model IDs  
**Reviewer:** Claude Opus 4.5

## Critical Issues

### 1. Discoverability Crisis
- **No onboarding**: First-time users see a cryptic interface with no indication of what to do
- **Hidden interactions**: Tap-to-expand on reflection panel, scroll-for-depth, phrase cloud expansion — all invisible
- **"Transform" button is buried**: Below the footer, labeled "transform" which is jargon
- **Axis labels are too subtle**: 9px ghost text doesn't communicate that X/Y are navigable dimensions

### 2. Touch Target Problems
- **Settings icon**: 16×16px is below the 44×44px iOS minimum
- **Language buttons**: 8px padding is cramped for fingers
- **Transform toggle**: 6px padding, tiny hit area
- **Phrase cloud items**: 4px padding, very hard to tap

### 3. Information Hierarchy Issues
- **Footer stats are meaningless to newcomers**: "Stillness: 0s", "Wandering: 0" — what do these mean?
- **Two "Depth" indicators**: One in STATE panel, one in footer — confusing duplication
- **STATE panel awakens but user doesn't know why**: No visual connection between movement and panel reveal

## Moderate Issues

### 4. Visual Design
- **Low contrast throughout**: `--text-ghost: #383850` on `--bg-abyss: #06060a` is ~1.5:1 ratio (WCAG requires 4.5:1)
- **Noise texture at z-index 10000**: Covers everything, might interfere with modals
- **Inconsistent border-radius**: 6px, 10px, 12px, 16px used seemingly randomly
- **"SF Mono" fallback chain missing**: Falls to system default if not installed

### 5. Interaction Feedback
- **No haptic feedback on mobile**: Touch events don't trigger vibration
- **Trail only shows path, not velocity**: Could use varying thickness
- **Region proximity lacks audio cue**: Contemplative apps often use subtle tones
- **No visual cue that reflection panel is tappable**

### 6. Settings Panel
- **API key field has no "show password" toggle**
- **No "test connection" button** for API key validation
- **Model names are technical jargon**: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4" means nothing to most users
- **Language section doesn't show current selection until you open settings**

---

## Minor Issues

### 7. Responsive Design
- **axis-bottom positioned at `bottom: 100px`**: Will overlap footer on short screens
- **Journey log at `top: 58px`**: Hardcoded, breaks if header height changes
- **max-width: 420px on reflection panel**: Could be wider on tablets
- **No landscape orientation handling**

### 8. Animation & Performance
- **30s ambient animation runs forever**: Could pause when tab is hidden
- **Trail stores 80 points**: Catmull-Rom on every frame for 80 points is heavy
- **Multiple box-shadows stacking**: `--shadow-strong` + `--shadow-inset` = expensive compositing

### 9. Content/Copy Issues
- **"Move gently to explore"**: Doesn't explain scroll = depth
- **Region names like "Presence", "Expansion"**: Abstract, may alienate users
- **Mixed language phrases might confuse**: User sees German/Hebrew without understanding multilingual feature

### 10. State Management
- **Phrase cloud close handler uses setTimeout(100ms)**: Race condition risk
- **`languageMode` is global var, not in state object**: Inconsistent architecture
- **DOM element cache never cleared on transformation**: Stale references possible

---

## Recommendations (Priority Order)

1. **Add first-run overlay** with gentle guidance: "Drag to explore • Scroll for depth • Tap prompts for more"
2. **Increase touch targets** to minimum 44×44px
3. **Fix contrast ratios** — bump ghost/dim text colors up
4. **Add visual affordance** to tappable elements (subtle border, chevron, etc.)
5. **Simplify footer** — remove or rename cryptic stats
6. **Show current language** in the main UI somewhere (not just settings)
7. **Add "What is this?" link** in header or settings
8. **Consider sound design** — optional ambient tones on region entry

## Fix Log

_Fixes will be logged below as they are implemented._


### Fix 1: First-run Onboarding (Critical #1)
- Added overlay with three hints: Drag, Scroll, Tap
- Shows on first visit, stores dismissal in localStorage
- 44px dismiss button with proper touch target

### Fix 2: Touch Targets (Critical #2)
- Settings toggle: 44×44px (was 16×16px)
- Language buttons: 44px min-height, 12px padding (was 8px)
- Transform toggle: 44px min-height, 12×20px padding (was 6×14px)
- Phrase cloud items: 40px min-height, 10×14px padding (was 4×10px)

### Fix 3: Contrast Ratios (Moderate #4)
- `--text-ghost`: #505068 (was #383850) — ~3:1 ratio now
- `--text-dim`: #6a6a88 (was #585870) — ~4:1 ratio now
- `--text-soft`: #9898b0 (was #8888a0) — improved

### Fix 4: Visual Affordances (Moderate #5)
- Added drag handle indicator to reflection panel (::after pseudo-element)
- Animates on hover, shrinks when expanded

### Fix 5: Footer Clarity (Critical #3)
- "Stillness" → "Rest" with tooltip
- "Wandering" → "Visited" (shows regions visited count)
- "Depth" → "Layer" (shows label like "Surface", "Noticing" instead of 0.50)

### Fix 6: Font Fallbacks (Minor)
- Added 'Fira Code', 'Consolas', 'Monaco' to monospace fallback chain
